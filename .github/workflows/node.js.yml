    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Check out the repository so Actions can acces our code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2️⃣ Install Bun via the official setup action
      # oven-sh/setup-bun sets up Bun, adds it to PATH, and caches the binary internally
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      # 3️⃣ Cache Bun dependencies for faster installs
      # ~/.bun      → Bun’s global binary/cache directory
      # ~/.cache/bun → Often used for package-level caching (like npm/yarn)
      # The key ensures cache invalidation when bun.lockb changes
      - name: Cache Bun dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.bun
            ~/.cache/bun
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-bun-${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lockb') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-bun-

      # 4️⃣ Install dependencies using Bun
      # This step will skip downloading modules that are already cached
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

      # 5️⃣ Build the NestJS project with Bun
      - name: Build
        run: bun run build

      # 6️⃣ Run test suite
      - name: Run tests
        run: bun run test

      # 7️⃣ (Optional) Lint codebase
